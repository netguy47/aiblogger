# Imagine a World Where the Colonial Marines from the Aliens Franchise Actually Existed as a Part of the USA Military

A speculative history of humanity's expansion into space and the birth of its ultimate protectors.

**Listen to the Narrative**

## Getting Started

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/astro-blog-starter-template
```

A live public deployment of this template is available at [https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev](https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
